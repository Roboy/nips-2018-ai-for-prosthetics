* Push tf.Session inside of TensorFlowNetwork. Optionally, it can be injected.
You shouldnt have to create a session for testing!!!
* Remove tflearn from tf_ddpg_agent
* Make sure tf_ddpg_agent graphs is correct
* Save to .ckpt files
* Implement agent.load_from()
* Test that expected and loaded agents are the same
* Test that two consecutive loaded agents are the same
* Make ExperienceTupleBatch return np arrays
